## What is UpTrain?

UpTrain is an open-source machine learning (ML) refinement tool that helps you understand how your models are performing in production. It provides several key features that help you answer important questions about your models and take action to improve their performance.

One of the key features of UpTrain is its ability to provide ML observability. It helps you answer questions such as:

- Is the performance of my model degrading over time? 📉
- Is my model encountering cases it was not trained on? 🤔
- Is my input data distribution different from the one I used to train my model? 📈
- Am I feeding the right data to my model, or are any of my data pre-processing pipelines broken? 🔍

In addition to providing observability, UpTrain also provides several key features to support ML refinement. These include:

- The ability to select the best data points to retrain your models, which can help save costs 💸
- The ability to proactively catch model issues and give you the opportunity to fix them or inform your customers before they experience issues due to incorrect model behavior 🚨
- A fully automated model refinement loop that allows you to easily monitor, retrain, compare, and deploy updated models 🤖

In summary, UpTrain is an advanced tool that helps you understand and improve the performance of your machine learning models in production. It provides a wealth of information about your models and their performance, and enables you to take action to improve their performance over time. 🚀
