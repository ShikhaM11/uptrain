## How UpTrain Works?

UpTrain is a powerful tool for monitoring and improving the performance of machine learning models in production. 🚀 One of its key features is its ability to monitor the difference between the dataset the model was trained on, and the real-world data points the model encounters during production.

This "difference" can be measured using custom statistical measures that are designed by ML practitioners based on their specific use case. Additionally, UpTrain monitors for edge cases by using rule-based smart signals on the model inputs.

If UpTrain detects a distribution shift or an increased frequency of edge cases, it raises an alert and identifies the subset of data that experienced these issues. This allows you to quickly and easily identify and address any potential issues with your model.

To improve the performance of the model on production samples, UpTrain retrains the model by taking a balanced mixture of the original training samples and the collected edge cases. This ensures that your model is able to perform well on a wide range of data, including edge cases that it may not have seen during training.

With UpTrain, you can be confident that your machine learning models are performing well in production, and that any issues are quickly identified and addressed. 

### Architecture: UpTrain

UpTrain is an advanced system that helps you improve the performance of your machine learning models in production. The following figure describes the high-level architecture of UpTrain.



With UpTrain, you can easily integrate your existing machine learning model training pipelines. It seamlessly integrates with any model type, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn, and can be used with any cloud provider, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. 🔌 Additionally, you can add any log type, such as model inputs, outputs, user feedback, and ground truth, to UpTrain for monitoring. 📊

UpTrain uses standard statistical tools to detect anomalies as well as any user-defined custom signals specific to your use case. 📚 This allows it to track degradation in model performance in real-time before it impacts business metrics, track data distribution changes due to ever-revolving userbase and prevent model drifts, and find outliers with custom rules and retrain on them to boost model accuracy. 🚨

The results of UpTrain's monitoring are shown to users in the form of alerts and dashboards. Users can proactively use UpTrain's real-time dashboards to monitor models in production and proactively catch model issues. 📈 When an issue is identified, UpTrain creates an improved model by retraining it on a balanced retraining dataset comprising of edge cases and problematic data points. 🧑‍💻

In summary, UpTrain is an easy-to-use, flexible, and powerful tool that helps you ensure the performance of your machine learning models in production. With UpTrain, you can ensure that your models are making accurate predictions, reducing the risk of errors, and improving your business metrics. 💯
